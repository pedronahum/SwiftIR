/// Shardy C API Wrapper Implementation
/// This file provides placeholder implementations that will be linked
/// against the actual libsdy_capi library.

#include "include/SdyCAPIWrapper.h"

// The actual implementations are provided by libsdy_capi.a/libsdy_capi.so
// from the Shardy build. This file exists to satisfy the Swift package
// structure requirements and provide documentation.

// Note: All function declarations in SdyCAPIWrapper.h are implemented by
// the Shardy library. When linking, ensure libsdy_capi is included.
